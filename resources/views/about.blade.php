            <p class="mb-6 text-left">

                A spunky, chubby teenager with gelled hair shot to fame after leading India to glory
                 in the Under-19 World Cup at Kuala Lumpur in early 2008. In an Indian team filled with
                  saint-like icons worthy of their own hagiographies, Virat Kohli, with his most un-Indian, 'bad-boy' intensity, would clearly be an outcast.

                Kohli has a seemingly hot head on his shoulders, but he channels all his anger while he
                is batting. Known to be an aggressive batsman always on the lookout for runs, he has a
                fairly sound , albeit slightly unconventional technique, which makes him judge the length
                of the ball earlier than most, and amazingly quick wrists to run his hands through the
                ball, even against fast bowlers. He is equally adept against pace and spin, and never looks
                ungainly at the crease. With nimble foot-movement against the spinners, he is known to be quite
                destructive when the situation demands it. He has had to fill some rather big shoes of his predecessors,
                and has done an admirable job to say the least.

                It became a no-brainer when he was asked to captain the Bangalore franchise on a permanent basis from 2012
                and it also translated into more consistency with the bat. Kohli soon turned into a fan favourite even as runs
                flowed from his bat and eventually becoming the leading-run scorer in the history of IPL. Circa, 2016 - the
                India and RCB captain blasted 973 runs - the most by any player in the history of the game and it included four
                hundreds - the most by a batsman in a single edition. Alas, all this didn't translate into a title triumph - one
                that has kept Kohli and Bangalore waiting so far (As of March 2023).

                The 20-year-old continued to impress for Delhi and dominated attacks, clearly demonstrating that he belonged at a
                much higher level; that junior cricket was beneath his standards. Kohli then traveled to Australia in 2009 for the Emerging
                players tournament and stamped his authority all over the bowling attacks. He added 'big-match temperament' to his résumé
                too, lacing a fluent hundred in the final against South Africa, and guiding his team to a clinical victory. The young prodigy,
                barely old enough to receive his man-of-the-match champagne, ended the tournament with 398 runs from 7 outings with two centuries
                and two fifties, ensuring that he remained fresh in the selectors' minds.

                The selectors had no choice but to give Kohli another go in the Indian side, and this time he strung together a number of impressive scores.
                After being given an extended run, he repaid their faith by notching up his maiden ODI hundred in an impressive run-chase against Sri Lanka
                in December 2009 - his first of many exemplary knocks in run-chases. In the World Cup final of 2011, the biggest stage of them all, Kohli,
                along with his Delhi teammate Gautam Gambhir, pulled off a largely underrated rescue effort with an 83-run stand after losing the openers early.
                This knock played a crucial role in setting the platform for MS Dhoni's fabled knock of 91*, which eventually won India the World Cup on that
                enchanting evening in Mumbai.<br>

                In the hangover of the World Cup euphoria, Kohli continued to take giant strides in the limited-overs format. Three years after his ODI debut,
                he was finally handed the coveted Test cap in the Caribbean islands in July 2011, owing to the need to rest the senior players. After a series
                each against the Dukes ball and the SG ball, it was now time for his trial against the Kookaburra Down Under. In the first two Tests, he seemed
                to lack the technique to play in Australia, maintaining his low stance on the bouncy tracks. He also had a rather restricting trigger movement
                with his front-foot routinely coming across towards off-stump, thereby hindering the necessary movement to play back-foot shots such as the pull
                and the cut.

                The selectors and the captain persisted with him going into the 3rd Test, and he delivered a break-through performance on a bouncy Perth wicket
                - an impressive 75 - where a visible change in technique was visible. He managed to stand tall, with a more open stance, and exhibited the
                back-foot shots in his repertoire during the course of the innings. The volatile Kohli managed to overshadow his impropriety in conduct with his
                performance in the final Test of the series. Notching up India's only century of a disastrous tour, Kohli was the shining light in amidst the
                chaos, as he stroked his way to a hundred in Adelaide exhibiting the will to improve and extraordinary focus under pressure in the searing heat
                and pressure of Australia.<br><br>While he grappled and clawed his way into the Test side, he went on a record-breaking spree in ODIs: the
                Indian record for the fastest to multiples-of-thousand runs in ODIs, culminating in the world record for the fastest to 9000 runs in ODIs. He
                was also the highest run-scorer for India in ODIs for three consecutive calendar years - 2010, 2011 and 2012 and won the ICC ODI cricketer of
                the year award in 2012
